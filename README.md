### ✨ introductions, of the informal variety ✨
hi, i'm Kiki (short for Kikimora, pronounced like the spider, Owl House character, Russian folk creature, or camoflauge, whichever you're most familiar with)! i'm a computational biologist and software engineer from new york city but i also dabble in a wide variety of things <br>

### questionably productive (software) engineering takes
- "why spend an hour doing something when you can spend ten hours automating it :3"
- "why learn blender when fusion360 has an animation tab \*insert clown music here\*"
- "brainf*ck can't be that hard, low-level languages are good to learn first"
- "oh don't worry, there's a nightmare of a C library from 1996 for that (yes this is targetted at CGAL)"

### the obligatory languages/softwares/OS section
- python, kotlin, java, bash, web assembly (text format!!), x86_64 assembly, *deeply terrible* javascript
- fusion 360, meshlab, autocad, solidworks (cfd, mostly), keyshot, indesign + illustrator, onshape, rhino
- pop-os! supremacy (i want a mac please... my computer takes 45 seconds to wake from sleep but only 10 to boot somehow)

- most of my code is for proprietary projects, but i <3 open source and would love to help out with an open source project
